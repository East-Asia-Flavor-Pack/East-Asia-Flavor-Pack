je_rlg_seoul_gyeongbokgung_poor_goal: "Gyeongbokgung Palace, which began with the Joseon Dynasty hundreds of years ago, was burned down after the Japanese and Manchu invasions and has not been properly rebuilt.\nPerhaps our generation is ready to undertake this task.\n\n<Currently unable to gain construction progress>"
je_rlg_seoul_gyeongbokgung_rebuild: "Reconstruction of Gyeongbokgung"
je_rlg_seoul_gyeongbokgung_rebuild_reason: "To restore the authority of the state, we have decided to magnificently rebuild the Northern Palace.\nHowever, as it will consume numerous materials and budget, we must proceed carefully while monitoring the country's circumstances."
je_rlg_seoul_gyeongbokgung_rebuild_goal: "This is the level of construction progress.\nWhen the progress is full, the construction will end and the palace reconstruction will be successfully completed.\nThe monthly construction progress added varies depending on the amount of resources invested in the construction."
je_rlg_seoul_dangbaek: "Inflation"
je_rlg_seoul_dangbaek_reason: "As a result of various domestic circumstances, we have inevitably decided to issue a large amount of debased currency.\nHowever, this policy can bring shocks to the national economy, and we must manage inflationary pressures through various means."
je_rlg_seoul_dangbaek_goal: "This figure represents the inflation risk due to the circulation of debased currency.\nIt basically increases weekly according to the amount issued, and the level of inflation expansion varies due to factors such as the precious metal content of the currency, minting technology, and the economic tier of the country."
eafp_kor_mainline.1500.t: "Rebuild Gyeongbokgung Palace?"
eafp_kor_mainline.1500.d: "Discussion on Rebuilding the Main Palace"
eafp_kor_mainline.1500.f: "Gyeongbokgung, as the main palace of Joseon, had maintained its status for a long time, but after being devastated during the Japanese and Manchu invasions, various circumstances prevented its restoration.\nToday, as internal turmoil and foreign barbarian threats shake the nation's discipline, opinions suggesting the reconstruction of the Northern Palace to strengthen our foundation have begun to emerge."
eafp_kor_mainline.1500.a: "This matter requires discussion."
eafp_kor_mainline.1501.t: "Donation Money"
eafp_kor_mainline.1501.d: "Securing Construction Funds"
eafp_kor_mainline.1501.f: "Palace construction certainly requires a substantial budget.\nSince our treasury alone cannot cover all the costs, a suggestion was made to collect donations called Wonnapjeon to supplement the construction expenses. Many noble families with good intentions have willingly contributed money."
eafp_kor_mainline.1501.a: "The nobility has become a great help!"
eafp_kor_mainline.1502.t: "Honoring Donors"
eafp_kor_mainline.1502.d: "Praise and Rewards"
eafp_kor_mainline.1502.f: "Although Wonnapjeon is basically a donation, it's rare for people to give large sums of money without any compensation.\nIf the court directly honors the donors with commendations and provides a small 'token of appreciation,' we might be able to maintain the donation atmosphere for a longer period."
eafp_kor_mainline.1502.a: "A donation is just a donation, but we can at least express our gratitude."
eafp_kor_mainline.1502.b: "Appoint suitable government positions to major donors."
eafp_kor_mainline.1503.t: "Voluntary Donations?"
eafp_kor_mainline.1503.d: "Rising Fatigue"
eafp_kor_mainline.1503.f: "As the court's encouragement for donations has gradually shifted from suggestions to requests, and now slowly to pressure, fatigue regarding donations is rising throughout society.\nAlthough we are still formally accepting them as donations, it seems we have already collected as much as possible within the country."
eafp_kor_mainline.1503.a: "But the name is the name, so at this point..."
eafp_kor_mainline.1503.b: "We welcome your voluntary donations!"
eafp_kor_mainline.1504.t: "Fire!"
eafp_kor_mainline.1504.d: "A great fire has broken out!"
eafp_kor_mainline.1504.f: "Shocking news.\nIn the midst of construction, a large fire broke out at the construction site last night, burning down numerous pavilions that had been built and spreading to the timber stacked as materials!\nThe flames were barely contained today, but there has been a massive loss of resources, which will cause significant delays in construction...\n\n#N <Construction Progress -250>#!"
eafp_kor_mainline.1504.a: "A sign of national ruin!"
eafp_kor_mainline.1504.b: "The end is near."
eafp_kor_mainline.1504.c: "If only the Geumhwadogam had remained..."
eafp_kor_mainline.1504.dy: "This is all because of those barbarians!!!"
eafp_kor_mainline.1504.e: "Oh..."
eafp_kor_mainline.1505.t: "Currency Debate"
eafp_kor_mainline.1505.d: "Opinions are raised that new currency should be issued"
eafp_kor_mainline.1505.f: "'We should mint new currency and circulate it widely.'\n'What nonsense is this? All precious metals are imported from Qing and Japan, how could you say such absurd things..'\n'Can you still not read the flow of the times? Day after day, Western cotton cloth enters indiscriminately, collapsing the livelihood of the people. Only by minting new high-value coins can we correct this.'\n'It's impossible to recklessly create large denominations, and even if we did, it would act as poison to Joseon!'\n'We have many pressing issues. The palace construction is also urgent! If you can speak so loudly, why don't you donate your entire fortune to the North Palace construction before speaking!'"
eafp_kor_mainline.1505.a: "Gentlemen, please calm yourselves..."
eafp_kor_mainline.1506.t: "Issuance of Dangbaekjeon"
eafp_kor_mainline.1506.d: "Left State Councillor Kim Byeonghak has reported."
eafp_kor_mainline.1506.f: "The people's lives are difficult and finances are depleted, yet we are undertaking major construction projects, making it impossible to sustain operations between departments.\nHumbly considering, money is something to be used with proper balance and restraint.\nIn the past, splitting Dangshipjeon or Dangohjeon into Dangijeon or Dangsamjeon was always a temporary expedient measure.\nNow that the nation's finances are severely depleted, there should be a principle of balancing profit and loss.\nIn my opinion, if we mint Dangbaekdaejeon and use it alongside the widely circulated Tongbo, it might help increase our finances to some extent.\n\n<A button to decide on issuing Dangbaekjeon will be activated in the journal.>"
eafp_kor_mainline.1506.a: "Your report is very good. Implement it immediately!"
eafp_kor_mainline.1507.t: "Petition"
eafp_kor_mainline.1507.d: "A petition regarding the Gyeongbokgung construction has been submitted."
eafp_kor_mainline.1507.f: "I humbly report.......(omitted)\nThe long construction has emptied the national treasury......(omitted)\nThe suffering of the people is immeasurable...(omitted)\nIt would be advisable to take a break from construction for a while."
eafp_kor_mainline.1507.a: "Your words are right. Proceed with the work at a measured pace.\n<Progress -50>"
eafp_kor_mainline.1507.b: "A valid point, but postponing it will result in greater losses.\n<Progress +-0>"
eafp_kor_mainline.1507.c: "#V SILENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#!\n<Progress +50>"
eafp_kor_mainline.1509.t: "The Miracle of Dangbaekjeon!"
eafp_kor_mainline.1509.d: "There's no such thing lololololol"
eafp_kor_mainline.1509.f: "No matter what lololol absolutely not!!!!!!!!!"
eafp_kor_mainline.1509.a: "The currency value will never return lolololololololololololol"
eafp_kor_mainline.1510.t: "Construction Complete"
eafp_kor_mainline.1510.d: "The Northern Palace has been rebuilt"
eafp_kor_mainline.1510.f: "Today, the Gyeongbokgung reconstruction project has officially been declared complete.\nAfter several eventful years, the main palace of Joseon has finally regained its original status!"

It began with a man named Kim Eung-do who lived in Yeonan, Hwanghae Province.\n\nHe visited the brothers Lee Myeong-seop and Lee Myeong-hyeok, descendants of Crown Prince Sohyeon living on Chodo Island, and incited them. Shortly after, a man named Chae Hui-jae also visited the brothers and proposed they be enthroned, forming a conspiracy with Myeong-seop as the leader and Kim Eung-do and Chae Hui-jae as the strategists.\n\nAmong them, Myeong-seop died of illness while being transported to Hanyang, his younger brother Myeong-hyeop was exiled to Hamgyeong Province, and the three ringleaders including Chae Hui-jae were executed by dismemberment."
