 jpf_joseon.1.d:0 "Second State Councilor Lee Ji-yeon has requested to thoroughly investigate matters related to heterodoxy."
 jpf_joseon.1.f:0 ""I have heard recently that the two police bureaus have captured dozens of heterodox criminals. Some have been sent to the State Tribunal, but almost all are determined to die rather than repent, with very few willing to confess and regret. Even from those already exposed, we cannot know the number of vicious and despicable groups secretly forming lairs. Not only are proper human relations collapsing and customs gradually being contaminated, but we cannot help but worry about concerns similar to the Yellow Turban Rebellion or White Lotus Society. In the current situation, we must investigate strictly and govern thoroughly, with the intention of killing people as a means of saving them."" # Bibyeonsa Records, Year 5 of Heonjong, March 5, 1839 (lunar), Right State Councilor Lee Ji-yeon attending and discussing punishment of heterodox criminals

I do not know how those not yet exposed will be dealt with and what will become of them. Let fathers instruct their sons and elder brothers instruct their younger brothers, thinking of surely reforming those who have gone astray and surely admonishing those who have not yet fallen.'" #Annals of Heonjong, Book 6, Year 5 of Heonjong, October 18, Entry 1, Royal edict against heterodoxy issued to the capital and provinces

je_korean_restoration_hwangok_reason:0 "The grain loan system was originally a beneficial relief measure to lend national resources to those in need to survive the winter, but it has now become a tool for the wealthy to practice usury against the poor.

je_korean_restoration_gunjeong_reason:0 "Military tax originally referred to one roll of cloth paid instead of military service. But nowadays, only three out of ten properly fulfill their military duties, while the rest use all sorts of means to evade the nation's eyes and escape service, leaving military registers and camps empty. The court must create new military registers and accurately count able-bodied men, ensuring no one is treated unjustly."
je_korean_restoration_jeonjeong:0 "Abolish the Abuses of Land Tax System"
je_korean_restoration_jeonjeong_reason:0 "Jeonjeong refers to the land tax imposed on rice paddies and fields, which is the oldest tax system paid to landowners. However, local government offices and landowners colluded to pass this burden onto farmers, charging several times the proper amount and pocketing the difference, even extorting rice and cloth from non-existent or barren lands, creating unspeakable abuses. To abolish these corrupt practices, the court must directly intervene by implementing nationwide land surveys and punishing corrupt officials and landowners to restore proper order."

je_korean_restoration_second:0 "Path to a Wealthy and Strong Nation"
je_korean_restoration_second_reason:0 "By correcting the corruption in the three administrations, we have completed the greatest task and laid the foundation. Now it is time to stand up and make our name known throughout the world."
je_korean_restoration_second_goal:0 "Complete all reforms"
donghak_complete_tt:0 "Resolve the peasant rebellion"
je_korean_restoration_economy:0 "Promotion of Commerce and Industry"
je_korean_restoration_economy_reason:0 "In the past, Yu Su-won said, 'For a country to develop, all four classes of people must diligently perform their duties without distinction of noble or base.' The distinction between scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants is an old teaching of Neo-Confucianism, but now we see that if scholars first establish order and reason, the rest - farmers, artisans, and merchants - will naturally devote themselves to their duties without encouragement. This is the true distinction of the four classes and the path to national prosperity."
je_korean_restoration_military:0 "Military System Reform"
je_korean_restoration_military_reason:0 "Looking back at the numerous problems in military administration, the long-standing local militia system has only led to evasion of military service and desertion. From now on, Joseon must establish a systematic regular army based on the Three Military Commands."
je_korean_restoration_politics:0 "Establishment of the Police Department"
je_korean_restoration_politics_reason:0 "Among the causes of numerous problems, the excessively reduced role of the Capital Police Bureau can be counted as one. Expanding its role and extending it to all eight provinces by establishing a new Police Department will greatly help in restoring order and security."
je_korean_restoration_education:0 "Abolition of Private Academies"
je_korean_restoration_education_reason:0 "The excessive number of private academies scattered throughout the country have long since become dens of vicious profiteers who suck the lifeblood of the people instead of honoring past sages and teaching scholarship. We must preserve only a few honest ones among these academies and expose and correct the accumulated corruption and abuses."
korean_restoration_2.1.t:0 "Path to a Wealthy and Strong Nation"
korean_restoration_2.1.d:0 "Now that we have cut out the rotten abscess, it is time to rise again."
korean_restoration_2.1.f:0 "In ancient times, Sima Qian said that when a country is wealthy and its military is strong, there will be no worries inside or outside; therefore, those who lead a country must strive to achieve this."

korean_restoration_2.4.f:0 "I was born in the East and received it in the East. Though the Way is the Heavenly Way, the learning is Eastern Learning. Moreover, as the land is divided into East and West, how can the West be called East, and how can the East be called West?"

korean_restoration_2.6.a:0 "Beautiful."
korean_restoration_2.7.t:0 "Birth of the Modern Army"
korean_restoration_2.7.d:0 "The military system reform has been completed, and the modern army has been established. Now it's time to determine its direction."
korean_restoration_2.7.f:0 "The army is the shield of the nation, and the sharp spear that surrounds the people."
korean_restoration_2.7.a:0 "Our forces should focus on defense by utilizing our land's terrain."
korean_restoration_2.7.b:0 "Attack is the best defense, we must focus on offense."
korean_restoration_2.8.t:0 "Establishment of the Modern Army"
korean_restoration_2.8.d:0 "A new military system has been introduced, and our army has become stronger. However, discontent still remains."
korean_restoration_2.8.f:0 "They call those soldiers who learn foreign martial arts 'Special Skills Force,' a name that is strange from the start. Making sons of military families and young scholars stand in lines with their upper garments removed, bowing to barbarian commoners in salute, instilling shame in them - this is something that should never be done."
korean_restoration_2.8.a:0 "Treat all soldiers equally"
korean_restoration_2.8.b:0 "Transition the military system in a balanced way"
korean_restoration_2.8.c:0 "Delay the wages of the old-style army"
korean_restoration_2.9.t:0 "Imo Military Rebellion"
korean_restoration_2.9.d:0 "Due to our focus on the modern army, the existing soldiers have begun to resist. According to rumors, they may soon start a rebellion."
korean_restoration_2.9.f:0 "The food they hope to be fed is merely nine mal of rice, yet even this has not been adequately provided for a year. They have managed their own provisions while diligently serving, without daring to disobey military orders, so it can be said they have maintained discipline."
korean_restoration_2.9.a:0 "Suppress all these traitors! Royal command!"
korean_restoration_2.9.b:0 "This is all due to my lack of virtue. Appease them."
korean_restoration_2.10.t:0 "Petition"
korean_restoration_2.10.d:0 "The yangban have submitted a petition regarding the establishment of the police bureau."
korean_restoration_2.10.f:0 "The police bureau is merely a new name for the Capital Police Bureau, which is like the State Tribunal that arrests criminals. We humbly suggest there is no need to expand and establish multiple agencies of the same function."
korean_restoration_2.10.a:0 "Accept it."
korean_restoration_2.10.b:0 "Whatever those people say, ignore it all."
korean_restoration_2.11.t:0 "Direct Appeal"
korean_restoration_2.11.d:0 "A commoner has come forward with a petition. It seems they have opinions about the ongoing reforms."
korean_restoration_2.11.f:0 "According to the Daejeonhoetong, a petition is when a commoner directly reports their concerns to the king in order to correct matters that do not make sense."
korean_restoration_2.11.a:0 "Accept it"
korean_restoration_2.11.b:0 "That's unreasonable"
korean_restoration_2.12.t:0 "Abolition of Private Academies"
korean_restoration_2.12.d:0 "The king has issued a royal command to abolish private academies."
korean_restoration_2.12.f:0 "Before sweeping them all away, we must first abolish Mandongmyo, the greatest source of corruption, and expose all the accumulated corruption and abuses in the process so that the Confucian scholars cannot resist."
korean_restoration_2.12.a:0 "Abolish them completely."
korean_restoration_2.12.b:0 "Implement it gradually."
korean_restoration_2.13.t:0 "Discussion on Foreign Language Education"
korean_restoration_2.13.d:0 "In the rapidly changing global situation, the need to teach foreign languages has arisen."
korean_restoration_2.13.f:0 "On the strange world map that came from beyond China, half of the map is colored as England and France, which is extremely bizarre."
korean_restoration_2.13.a:0 "Encourage English education for scholars."
korean_restoration_2.13.b:0 "Encourage French education for scholars."

 je_korean_restoration_third_goal:0 "Bring in more systematic and advanced culture from the West."
 korean_restoration_3.1.t:0 "Discussion on Constitutional Monarchy"
 korean_restoration_3.1.d:0 "The whole world is riding the wave of constitutional monarchy. Joseon must also join this trend."
 korean_restoration_3.1.f:0 "Your Majesty, looking at the governing systems of Western powers, most of them have adopted constitutional monarchy. How about discussing this matter? It will surely benefit our country."
 korean_restoration_3.1.a:0 "That's a good idea."
 korean_restoration_3.1.b:0 "The current rule of law is sufficient."
 korean_restoration_3.2.t:0 "New Judiciary"
 korean_restoration_3.2.d:0 "Originally, Joseon was a nation ruled by law with legal codes such as Gyeongguk Daejeon, but over the years, corruption naturally accumulated and its effectiveness weakened. Young officials have come to report to the king about establishing a new judiciary."
 korean_restoration_3.2.f:0 "Looking at our current judicial system, its authority is scattered everywhere, making it difficult to operate efficiently. We wish to establish a Western-style judiciary, so please grant your permission."
 korean_restoration_3.2.a:0 "Do as you wish."
 korean_restoration_3.2.b:0 "What we have now is sufficient."
 korean_restoration_3.3.t:0 "Establishment of Postal Service"
 korean_restoration_3.3.d:0 "We need a more systematic and modern communication system than the current system of messengers and signal fires."
 korean_restoration_3.3.f:0 "I've heard that in the West, they establish specialized postal departments to facilitate communication between government and civilians. How about we do the same?"
 korean_restoration_3.3.a:0 "Establish a department in charge of postal services and call it the Postal Bureau."
korean_restoration_3.3.b:0 "The losses seem greater than the gains. Stop it."
korean_restoration_3.4.t:0 "Introduction of the Solar Calendar"
korean_restoration_3.4.d:0 "Our current calendar falls short of global trends. In an era of global integration, we must adapt."
korean_restoration_3.4.f:0 "Your Majesty, our country has a systematic lunar calendar, but it is not commonly used throughout the world. Please grant permission to introduce the solar calendar."
korean_restoration_3.4.a:0 "I grant permission."
korean_restoration_3.4.b:0 "No matter how much we globalize, how can we change even our calendar?"
korean_restoration_3.5.t:0 "Women's Rights Advancement"
korean_restoration_3.5.d:0 "As Joseon's modernization progresses smoothly, the number of highly educated women is increasing. Some women who are dissatisfied with our country's discriminatory women's rights have demanded rights similar to those in Western countries."
korean_restoration_3.5.f:0 "At this morning's royal council, the Hanseong Magistrate reported to Your Majesty, "Your Highness, I humbly report that yesterday at noon, many women gathered in the streets holding signs requesting reconsideration of women's rights. Upon investigation by myself and other officials, we found that women's rights are already advancing in the West. Although their claims contradict the Neo-Confucian principles that have guided Joseon since King Taejo's time, their actions are becoming increasingly radical, and I fear this may lead to unrest. Please consider this matter carefully." After long deliberation, Your Majesty decreed...""
korean_restoration_3.5.a:0 "The advancement of women's rights is civilization and enlightenment. Grant their requests."
korean_restoration_3.5.b:0 "A woman's duty is childbirth and service to the family. Remember this."
korean_restoration_3.6.t:0 "Introduction of Standardized Weights and Measures"
korean_restoration_3.6.d:0 "Joseon's weights and measures are disconnected from the world. If we fail to reform this, Joseon will be buried in the tide of history."
korean_restoration_3.6.f:0 "In this era of trading goods with countries around the world, our weights and measures do not match those of other countries, making business difficult. Therefore, we wish to change this system and request your permission."
korean_restoration_3.6.a:0 "Introduce the metric system that is already used in many countries."
korean_restoration_3.6.b:0 "Introduce the yard-pound system used in Britain."
korean_restoration_3.6.c:0 "In my view, yard... anyway, our system seems better than those."
korean_restoration_3.7.t:0 "Introduction of Banking"
korean_restoration_3.7.d:0 "The introduction of a systematic modern banking system is the cornerstone of capitalism."
korean_restoration_3.7.f:0 "Your Majesty, a bank is a place that collects people's money and conducts business based on it, which greatly helps the circulation of capital. Would it be appropriate to introduce this system?"
korean_restoration_3.7.a:0 "Establish a bank in the court and test it."
korean_restoration_3.7.b:0 "There seems to be no need to introduce it."
korean_restoration_3.8.t:0 "Introduction of Western-style Official Uniforms"
korean_restoration_3.8.d:0 "To escape from the name of pre-modernity and leap toward becoming a civilized nation, we must learn everything from the West without discrimination - their technology, ideology, and everything else."
korean_restoration_3.8.f:0 "In order to think like Westerners, we must dress like Westerners, eat like Westerners, and live like Westerners. And the first step of such civilization and enlightenment is to change our official uniforms to Western style. This will create a good impression on the Westerners who will visit more frequently in the future, and will be a sign that Joseon has finally entered the path of becoming a civilized nation."
korean_restoration_3.8.a:0 ""No matter how modernized we become, should we change even our clothing? Stop this."" 
korean_restoration_3.8.b:0 ""It is right to follow the dress code of Britain, the most powerful country where the sun never sets."" 
korean_restoration_3.8.c:0 ""I heard that France is considered the most cultured nation in the West."" 
korean_restoration_3.8.e:0 ""It is right to follow the frugal and practical Prussian way."" 
korean_restoration_3.9.t:0 "Short Hair Decree"
korean_restoration_3.9.d:0 "In the West, short hair is the standard hairstyle. Unlike topknots, it is easy to manage."
korean_restoration_3.9.f:0 "Short hair is beneficial for health and convenient for work, which is why it is commonly used in the West. Please allow us to introduce this."
korean_restoration_3.9.a:0 "Implement the Short Hair Decree." 
korean_restoration_3.9.b:0 "It is said that the body, hair, and skin are received from parents, how could we cut our topknots?" 
korean_restoration_3.10.t:0 "Monetary Taxation"
korean_restoration_3.10.d:0 "The system of paying taxes in grain is too inconvenient. Paying taxes in money will be easier to manage."
korean_restoration_3.10.f:0 "Our country has implemented the Daedong Law, limiting the tax system to grain, but it is still inconvenient to manage. How about collecting taxes centered on money like in the West?"
korean_restoration_3.10.a:0 "It would be good to implement it." 
korean_restoration_3.10.b:0 "I don't think there is a need for that." 
korean_restoration_3.11.t:0 "Modern Education"
korean_restoration_3.11.d:0 "Joseon's education system is too biased toward Neo-Confucianism. A modern education system is needed."
korean_restoration_3.11.f:0 "To properly handle Western things, study is necessary, but our country's education is biased toward Confucianism, so reform is needed."
korean_restoration_3.11.a:0 "Let them learn Western things."
korean_restoration_3.11.b:0 "Confucianism is a major issue."
korean_restoration_3.12.t:0 "Reorganization of the State Council"
korean_restoration_3.12.d:0 "Originally, the State Council was a pillar supporting Joseon's central politics. But after many changes over time, it has now fallen into an obstacle full of corruption and inefficiency. Some progressive ministers have requested the king to reorganize the State Council into a cabinet."
korean_restoration_3.12.f:0 "Your Majesty, I humbly report that the current State Council has once fallen due to powerful families, and public perception is not good. How about reorganizing our State Council into a cabinet, modeled after European political systems? Please consider our humble opinion!"
korean_restoration_3.12.a:0 "Your intentions are truly right. Abolish the State Council and form a Western-style cabinet."
korean_restoration_3.12.b:0 "The State Council has already been reformed. There is no problem."
korean_restoration_3.13.t:0 "Discussion on the Class System"
korean_restoration_3.13.d:0 "The class system has effectively created four classes in Joseon. The yangban class is no longer necessary."
korean_restoration_3.13.f:0 "Originally, yangban were the same as commoners, but at some point, yangban gained privileges and wielded power. As the West has abolished classes and made everyone equal citizens, it is appropriate for us to follow suit."
korean_restoration_3.13.a:0 "Abolish the class system, and integrate the lowest class into commoners."
korean_restoration_3.13.b:0 "The class system does not align with virtuous governance, but too radical reforms will cause chaos."
korean_restoration_3.14.t:0 "Introduction of New Currency"
korean_restoration_3.14.d:0 "Despite numerous failures, currency is now a necessity, not a choice."
korean_restoration_3.14.f:0 "Your Majesty, I humbly report that although currency can cause great problems for the country if mishandled, as seen in past cases, using currency is now essential as we interact with Western countries."
korean_restoration_3.14.a:0 "Your intention seems right. Begin introducing currency throughout the eight provinces."
korean_restoration_3.14.b:0 "Have you forgotten history? Currency is not acceptable."
korean_restoration_3.15.t:0 "The Emergence of Corporations"
korean_restoration_3.15.d:0 "Companies that move capital on a large scale are the flowers of modernization."
korean_restoration_3.15.f:0 "The Hanseong Magistrate reports that merchants in Hanseong have formed a group to trade with foreign countries, calling themselves a corporation."
korean_restoration_3.15.a:0 "Support them to revitalize corporations."
korean_restoration_3.15.b:0 "Tax them"
korean_restoration_3.16.t:0 "Completion of Reforms"
korean_restoration_3.16.d:0 "After numerous discussions, Joseon's reforms have finally been completed. Although not everything is perfect, it is enough to compete with the great powers."
korean_restoration_3.16.f:0 "Your Majesty, the American ambassador says that the United States has declared it will no longer sign unequal treaties with Joseon. I humbly predict that other great powers will soon express similar intentions."
korean_restoration_3.16.a:0 "Very good."
