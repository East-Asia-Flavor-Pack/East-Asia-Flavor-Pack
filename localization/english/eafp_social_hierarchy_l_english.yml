four_occupations_system: "Four Occupations"
four_occupations_system_desc: "The Four Occupations is a traditional social order in East Asia grounded in Confucian values. It divides society into four primary occupational strata—scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants—reflecting a Confucian worldview that prioritizes agriculture as the foundation of the state while placing relatively lower value on profit-seeking activities."

#classes: four_occupations_system
shi_class: "Shi (Scholars)"
shi_class_desc: "The ruling stratum at the top of the Four Occupations. They cultivate learning and virtue and bear responsibility for governing the state. In line with Confucian ideals, they were regarded as the most important guides of society. Through the civil service examinations they entered office to participate in politics, held land, and enjoyed privileges such as exemptions from taxes and corvée."
nong_class: "Nong (Farmers)"
nong_class_desc: "In theory, the group ranked next after the scholars. Producing the food that is the foundation of the state, they were respected as indispensable in a Confucian society. In practice, however, they often suffered from heavy taxes and corvée, and many lived difficult lives due to lack of land ownership."

gong_class: "Gong (Artisans)"

shang_class: "Shang (Merchants)"
shang_class_desc: "The merchant group, considered the lowest among the Four Occupations. Because they did not produce goods themselves but pursued profit by circulating them, their activities were seen within the Confucian value system as unproductive and base."

jianmin: "Base People"
