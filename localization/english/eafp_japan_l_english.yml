# Shogunate Authority Journal
je_bakuhantaisei: "Bakuhan System"
je_bakuhantaisei_reason: "The Edo Shogunate, established by Tokugawa Ieyasu after the Battle of Sekigahara, has ruled Japan for hundreds of years. However, the Shogunate's authority has been gradually weakening recently. Amid increasing external pressure and internal discontent, the 'Sonnō jōi' faction criticizes the Shogunate's incompetence and advocates for reforms centered on the Emperor.\n\nIf appropriate countermeasures are not prepared in this situation, the Tokugawa family's rule may collapse, swept away by a massive wave.\n\n#bold Shogunate Politicians#!\nEven though the power of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] is formidable, they cannot run the country alone. Therefore, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] issues orders and carries out missions through #bold character interactions#! with their subordinate vassals.\n\n#bold Rōjū#! are the highest vassals directly under the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] who oversee the Shogunate's state affairs. They supervise local daimyos and monitor whether administration and justice in major cities are conducted fairly.\n\n#bold Rōjū Shuza#! is the leading position among the Rōjū, responsible for overseeing finances. This person can perform missions more powerfully and can carry out finance-related missions. In return, this person gains greater influence.\n\n#bold Tairō#! is a non-regular position in the Edo Shogunate, ranking above Rōjū, and is a top position specially appointed when the Shogunate is in crisis or when the Shogun is young. This person has powerful influence and can perform missions befitting that status.\n\n#bold Factions#!\nThose at the core of the Shogunate do not move as one body. They are largely divided into two factions and will act for the benefit of their own faction. If one side gains excessive power, it may even threaten the authority of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]."

We wish to announce this letter to each village, but due to its vastness, we cannot deliver it everywhere, so we post it at shrines in the nearest large villages.

### Assembly

JAP_democracy.3.d: "Ammunition Looting Incident"
JAP_democracy.3.f: "After his memorial was rejected and he was defeated in the power struggle with the former councilors, Saigo Takamori (西鄕隆盛) returned to his hometown and established a private school, where he began to gather forces in Satsuma. Their consolidated power became strong enough to threaten the government, and officials began to view the private school as 'an institution that cultivates anti-government activists.' As suspicions grew, Police Superintendent Kawaji Toshiyoshi dispatched 24 police officers led by Nakahara Naoo to Kagoshima under the pretext of 'returning home' to spy on and divide the private school. The students at the school found the 'mass' return of Nakahara Naoo and others suspicious and showed vigilance in trying to discover their purpose. Later, the new government secretly sent the Sekiryumaru (赤龍丸) to Kagoshima to remove weapons and ammunition from the Army Artillery warehouse in Kagoshima Prefecture to Osaka. The main purpose of this removal was to transfer the manufacturing equipment for Snider rifle ammunition, which was the main equipment of the Japanese Army at that time, to Osaka, but this was discovered by the private school forces. The students were angered that the new government had 'stolen' Satsuma's 'property' like 'thieves,' and at the same time, to obtain weapons and ammunition in preparation for an expected confrontation, they raided the Somota (草牟田) gunpowder warehouse at night and seized bullets and weapons."

JAP_democracy.5.f: "Seven private school executives including Shinohara Kunimoto, Kono Shuichiro, and Taki Shichinozo held a meeting and asked Taniguchi Tota to investigate Nakahara and the police officers. That same evening, through Taniguchi's information, they learned that Nakahara's group had returned with the purpose of assassinating Saigo. Private school executives including Shinohara, Fuchibe Gunpei, Ikenoue Shiro, and Kono Shuichiro discussed their options and dispatched Saigo Kobe, Saigo Takamori's fourth younger brother, to Konejime (小根占) where Saigo was hunting. Additionally, Kirino Toshiaki, who had returned to Kagoshima from Yoshidamura (吉田村) after hearing about the ammunition looting incident, conspired with Shinohara Kunimoto and others, and on February 2, sent Henmi Jurota and two others to Konejime. After hearing about the ammunition looting incident from Saigo Kobe and Henmi, Saigo returned to Kagoshima to calm the agitated private school students who were stirred up by rumors of the assassination plot. On his way back, private school students from various regions rushed to protect him, and by the time he arrived in Kagoshima, a considerable number of people had gathered. The private school faction captured and severely tortured Nakahara and about 60 others, obtaining a 'confession' stating that Superintendent Kawaji had instructed Nakahara to assassinate Saigo Takamori. Many private school students became enraged and reached a boiling point. In their anger, they gathered an army and declared war against the new government."
