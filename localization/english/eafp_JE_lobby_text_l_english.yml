je_chinese_westernization_lobby: "The West is barbaric, but their technology and weapons are impressive. Although we cannot fully embrace their knowledge and culture, their technology and tactics can make the Qing Dynasty rich and powerful, and save the nation from external threats."
je_dowager_cixi_lobby: "Who rules the Forbidden City? Will the Empress Dowager Cixi, who became the de facto ruler of the Qing Dynasty after the passing of the Xianfeng Emperor, continue to wield her iron fist, or will the grown Emperor finally be allowed to assert his authority?"
je_manchus_and_han_lobby: "As the Mandate of Heaven for the Qing Dynasty is imperiled, the suppressed conflict between the Han and Manchu peoples is on the verge of erupting."

je_bakuhantaisei_lobby: "The Edo Shogunate's governing system, the Bakuhan Taisei, which adhered to a policy of national isolation, is fundamentally shaken by external pressure and internal discontent. Forces advocating 'Sonnō jōi' (Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians) criticize the Shogunate's incompetence and demand a new order centered on the Emperor."
je_bakufu_kaikaku_lobby: "After centuries of stagnation, the Shogunate's system is now too old. We must attempt reform again and again."
je_liberty_civil_right_movement_lobby: "Nationalist ideas are spreading in Japan, and many people are beginning to gather their will and demand their rights."
je_seikanron_lobby: "We have become an empire, and thus we must have colonies. The best path is to re-occupy the Korean Peninsula across the sea, which was subject to us during Empress Jingū's time but has since ceased paying tribute."

je_korean_kings_health_lobby: "The King's health is failing, causing immense concern among the officials. With no heir for several years, a sense of anxiety that the foundation of the state might be shaken is spreading among the court ministers."
je_korean_land_problem_lobby: "The excellent bureaucratic system that Joseon once boasted has gradually broken down through the two major wars and centuries of time. What once supported administration and the people's livelihoods has now become a rotting snare that constricts the people. We must abolish the corruption and restore the nation's discipline, but this requires delicately handling the three balance weights that form society."
je_korean_imsul_uprising_lobby: "Despite the implementation of policies like the Gyunyeokbeop (Equal Tax Law) and the expansion of the Daedongbeop (Uniform Land Tax Law), the accumulated ills of centuries are not easily solved. In this situation, public sentiment is growing increasingly volatile, and cries of lament are heard among the populace."
je_sedo_politics_lobby: "Since the accession of the young King, state affairs have left the King's hands and fallen into the grasp of specific consort families. A few families, led by the Andong Kim clan, monopolize key positions in the Bibyeonsa (Border Defense Council), effectively privatizing state governance."
je_korean_reformation_lobby: "Only by reforming the military system, promoting the interests of agriculture, industry, and commerce, and learning the production of new technologies to strengthen ourselves, can we achieve self-reliance and independence among the nations of the world."

je_khmer_issue_lobby: "Cambodia is under our rule, but the Khmer people's resistance to this is intensifying."
