heavenly.102.f: "After careful consideration day and night, I have found a method that does not harm the people, benefits military provisions, and will be convenient for the people in the long run - I believe collecting contributions from merchants is most appropriate. The Lihahe region has abundant rice at low prices, and in the past, we dispatched commissioners to villages such as Xiannumiao, Shaobai, Yineng, and Zhangwanggu, somewhat imitating Governor-General Lin Zexu's method. We had rice merchants donate 50 wen per shi of rice and half a wen per dou, which did not interfere with people's livelihoods at all, and the amount collected was quite substantial. From September of last year until now, rice merchants have donated nearly 20,000 shi. This method does not disturb the people nor exhaust the merchants, so for several months, merchants and people have lived peacefully.\n\nI believe this method has two benefits, and like a stream that flows continuously over time, it provides practical benefits to military supplies. Therefore, I now want to spread this method again to rice merchants in all areas of Lihahe. All large merchants would donate roughly 1 percent per 100, and in some cases less than 1 percent, as determined through mutual discussion. Small merchants and craftsmen would all be exempted, allowing them to receive generous treatment. Currently, all merchants in Xiannumiao have already agreed to start donating, and the regulations established in that village have been printed and distributed to each region for implementation. I am prepared to report at any time, according to the actual situation, how much can be donated from each area of Lihahe. If a large amount is collected, it will not only provide resources for defense but also help coordinate other necessary military affairs."

What began as small arrogance gradually escalated to the point where he looked down upon not only the other three kings but even attempted to belittle the Heavenly King himself.\n\nThe Heavenly King, judging that this could no longer be overlooked, secretly ordered the Northern King to suppress the Eastern King, who had already gone too far. However, the conflict among the commanders under him was much deeper than the Heavenly King had anticipated, and in the process of suppressing the Eastern King, the Northern King slaughtered tens of thousands of the Eastern King's soldiers.\n\nThe internal division of the Heavenly Kingdom has now reached a point where even the Heavenly King himself can hardly control it."

# First Opium War

first_opium_war.1.d: "Despite issuing several edicts since 1799, there is no sign of the opium spread stopping."
first_opium_war.1.f: "It is truly regrettable to exchange the mud of foreigners for China's silver. Furthermore, the people of the country will undoubtedly wander about, begging everywhere, wasting time and losing their livelihoods."
first_opium_war.1.a: "New measures must be taken."

first_opium_war.2.d: "Xu Naiji, the Junior Guardian of the Heir Apparent, has submitted a memorial about opium. He states that the stricter the crackdown on opium, the more widely the resulting evil spreads, and urgently requests changes to the opium regulations."
first_opium_war.2.f: "All Western countries have opened their markets to their ships for over a thousand years, and only the British are opium merchants. It is wrong to cut off trade with all other countries in order to cut off British trade. Moreover, hundreds of thousands of people living along the coast rely entirely on trade for their livelihood - how should they be dealt with? Furthermore, barbarian ships on the high seas can choose any island as an anchorage for repairs, and vessels can meet them there, so trade cannot be cut off. In recent years, foreign ships have visited all ports in Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangnan, Shandong, and even Tianjin and Manchuria to sell opium. Although temporarily expelled by local authorities, the amount they sold was reportedly not small. Therefore, while we should cut off commerce in Guangdong, it seems impossible to prevent smuggling.\n\nNow, closing the ports is not the answer, and the laws on opium are quite ineffective, so the only remaining method is to return to the previous system and allow barbarian merchants to import opium as medicine by paying customs duties. After passing through customs, it should only be delivered to the Hong merchants as goods without payment. The barbarians will also willingly comply when they realize that the amount of customs duties they have to pay is less than what they now spend on bribes. Foreign money should be treated equally with silver ingots, and its outflow should be equally prohibited. When offenders are caught, the opium that may be theirs should be completely destroyed and their money confiscated as punishment."
first_opium_war.2.a: "The harm of opium is already crystal clear, yet how could we allow such poison?"

chi_flavor.4.f: "A heavy pall of fear cloaked Beijing, deepening as dusk fell, a stark reminder of the [SCOPE.sCountry('occupying_country').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] troops that had recently desecrated the city, pillaging the regal Summer Palace. The devastation, on the other hand, was far from over. The enemy's commander, relentless in his conquest, demanded the utter obliteration of the royal residence. As the order echoed, a cataclysmic blaze ignited, the palace surrendering to a fateful inferno. The flames danced manically for three harrowing days, reducing the once grand edifice to mere embers and debris. The Summer Palace, formerly an emblem of magnificence, was reduced to mere memory and ashes."

chi_flavor.6.d: "As the winds of industrialization sweep across the country, even the timeless waters of the Yangtze River bear witness to the changing tides. One of its veteran boatmen, whose life has been inextricably linked with the river, observes these transformations with mixed emotions."
chi_flavor.6.f: "With the dawn's blush sweeping over the Yangtze, the sunburned boatman witnesses his homeland's familiar tapestry now disrupted by growing industrial giants and smoke-belching chimneys. The once-vibrant river under the smog-filled sky has acquired an unfamiliar hue. Touching his time-weathered oar, its surface polished smooth by decades of devoted usage, he whispers to the unresponsive river, \"Times are changing, old friend.\"\n\nAs noon's heat takes hold, the river transforms into a busy avenue of steamboats and barges, a procession of modern machinery alien to his youthful innocence. The grating roars of these iron titans rudely supplant the river's peaceful symphony with a mechanical uproar. Overwhelmed by nostalgia, he yearns for the serene days shared only with his simple wooden boat and the mighty Yangtze's vast embrace.\n\nWith dusk's arrival, the setting sun paints the industrial horizon with a vibrant palette of orange and red, stirring emotions within the boatman. The sight of the ancient blending with the novel, of nature yielding to human progress, elicits feelings as unsettling as they are captivating. Reflecting, the boatman muses, \"The Yangtze of my youth has changed\" contemplating, \"but perhaps change is the only constant. I just hope we remember where we came from... and the river that carried us this far.\""

I suspect that either the historian's words are incorrect or it accounts for countries beyond Europe. Today, there are as many countries outside Europe as there are bushes. If there were no laws, how could those countries exist? This is why Teacher Ding Weiliang (W.A.P. Martin) translated the Elements of International Law. Weiliang is skilled in Chinese and foreign languages, and he asked Chen Jin of Yicheng, Li Shangzhi of Zhengzhou, Fang Junsi of Zhengyuan, and Mo Hongdao of Dazhu to delete and correct this text once before returning, so Weiliang can be called a well-learned scholar who loves the old.'" # preface 1, Elements of International Law

je_chinese_westernization: "Yong Yi Bian Xia"
je_chinese_westernization_reason: "Alas, how has the world come to this? Since the late Qianlong era, officials have become addicted to opium and the common people have been bewitched by heterodox cults, while the cunning foreigners spread their religions, distribute opium, plunder China's silver, and encroach upon the Emperor's domain from east and west. How did the Great Qing come to this? Where has the glorious era of prosperity gone? \n\nThis cannot continue. The Ming survived the northern barbarians and Japanese pirates only because of Zhang Juzheng's reforms. The situation of the Great Qing has become critical; if we cannot change, we will only repeat the fate of the Yuan dynasty. To survive, we must change."

je_chinese_westernization_army: "Yong Yi Bian Xia: Army Modernization"
je_chinese_westernization_army_reason: "The once-proud Eight Banners have become outdated, showing only disgrace during the Jinan rebellion. While mighty Russia encroaches on the Western Regions, our army, intoxicated by past glory, has let its spearheads rust. The defense of our northwestern frontier depends solely on rebuilding our army.\n\nWe must establish sufficient schools to introduce Western military technology, master these military skills, and apply them to our army. This will stop Russia and stabilize the frontier regions - this is the Frontier Defense."
je_chinese_westernization_navy: "Yong Yi Bian Xia: Navy Modernization"
je_chinese_westernization_navy_reason: "In ancient times, those who discussed controlling barbarians knew the enemy's situation like the palm of their hand. Now, ships travel across the 90,000 li of the earth, and foreigners invade China by sea. How can we not learn the barbarians' strengths to subdue them?\n\nBy manufacturing sturdy cannons and ships to create a fleet stationed in the Southeast seas, the country will be at peace, coastal people can sleep with their legs stretched out, and foreigners will not dare to covet the Emperor's position. This is the Sea Defense."
je_chinese_westernization_industry: "Yong Yi Bian Xia: Industrialization"
je_chinese_westernization_industry_reason: "Today, the manufacture of machinery is the foundation for countering the foreign challenge and the basis of self-strengthening. When the crafts of all trades are properly equipped, the construction of palaces and tools will make fortifications and ships stronger, and all aspects of practical utility will be enhanced. How can we not adopt foreigners' strengths and make them our own?\n\nThrough Western steam-powered machines, we can complete in one day what would take a thousand craftsmen, manufacture textiles, paper, and porcelain, mine iron for weapons, and become so strong that none would dare challenge us. This is Self-Strengthening."
je_chinese_westernization_government_reform: "Yong Yi Bian Xia: Government Reform"
je_chinese_westernization_government_reform_reason: "Why must laws change? Change is a universal principle throughout history. The Book of Changes states: 'When in difficulty, change; when changed, progress; when progressing, endure.' \n\nAs times change and nations compete daily with each other, if we merely sit idle clinging to old laws without thought, we will, like India, preserve the old without changing and become a colony. Therefore, we must transform our laws ourselves - this is Reform."

je_chinese_westernization_international_prestige: "Yong Yi Bian Xia: Establishing International Status"
je_chinese_westernization_international_prestige_reason: "Today's world can no longer compare to that of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties. Western nations are already surrounding and looking for weaknesses in the Great Qing - this is truly a crisis of national extinction.\n\nWe must comfort vassals like Vietnam and Korea to make them our frontier forces, strengthen internal and external defenses to not lose even an inch of Chinese territory, and prevent barbarians from violating our people. Only this can prevent partition."

This institution will be responsible for treaty negotiations, management of foreign trade, and handling diplomatic relations with foreign powers."
chinese_westernization.1.f: "\"I believe that all matters under heaven will change when pushed to their limits, and understanding comes through change. Chinese intellectuals have long been lost in trivial verses and calligraphy, while most brave warriors are rough and ignorant of how the world works. When the empire was peaceful, they regarded foreign weapons as mere novelties or evil tricks not worth learning. Yet when war breaks out, they are amazed at how strange and marvelous foreign weapons are, claiming we cannot match them. I believe that Westerners have been studying weapons as a discipline to preserve their bodies and minds for hundreds of years. I think that for China to strengthen itself, we must learn foreign weapons, and to do so, we must acquire the machines that make these devices. To obtain these machines and technicians, we should establish specialized examinations to select scholars. Then, scholars will pursue knowledge and refine their skills throughout their lives, aiming for wealth and fame, and talented individuals will gather like clouds.\""

# Currently, military training of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is conducted separately in each province, leading to inconsistent standards and a lack of coordination between troops. To address this issue, the government has proposed a plan to unify military training and conduct it centrally. However, many provincial governors are against this plan, arguing that it infringes upon their autonomy and could lead to a loss of power.
chinese_westernization.103.f: "Within the Qing Dynasty, the debate over centralizing military training has sparked intense political conflict. Supporters argue that a unified army is necessary to protect the nation from external attacks while maintaining internal stability. They believe centralizing military training would ensure consistent discipline and improve coordination between units. Opponents, however, worry that this plan would undermine provincial autonomy and concentrate power in the central government. They fear their provincial military resources would be depleted, weakening their power."
# Within the Qing Dynasty, the dispute over centralizing military training has sparked a bitter political conflict. On the one hand, supporters of the idea claim that a unified army is required to safeguard the country from outside assault while also maintaining internal stability. They see centralizing military training as a way to ensure consistent standards and improve troop coordination. Opponents, on the other hand, worry that the plan undermines provincial autonomy and could lead to a concentration of power in the central government. They are concerned that their provinces' military resources would be drained and their power will be undermined.

Sixteen members of the imperial family were dragged in, shivering in the cold with only a thin layer of clothing. All the people were watching the scene. When the time came, the executioner gave the order, and the executioner grabbed the criminal's neck, dragged him to the guillotine, and pressed him down. At that moment when only the sound of falling snow could be heard, they say it was heard. The sound of a crunch.\n\nThere is no law that says what happened to the French Emperor cannot happen here. Please listen to my advice.\""
