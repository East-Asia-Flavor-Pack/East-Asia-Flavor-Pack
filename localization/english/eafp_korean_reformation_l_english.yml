je_korean_reformation: "National Wealth and Military Strength"
je_korean_reformation_reason: "Taking Confucian 'Dao' as the foundation, only those who are well-versed in current affairs can know how to save the country. The 'Gi' of the West is unmatched in the world, so how can it be shameful to adopt and use it? Reforming the military system, promoting the interests of agriculture, commerce, and industry, and learning the production of new instruments are urgent priorities to strengthen our power. Western countries have already implemented new laws and become prosperous, so if we now preserve the good aspects of the old system but do not adapt to the times, how can we maintain our independent sovereignty among all nations?"
je_korean_reformation_goal: "National Wealth and Military Strength [Concept('concept_journal_entry', '$concept_journal_entries$')] 3 completed"
je_korean_reformation_society: "National Wealth and Military Strength: Social Reform"
je_korean_reformation_society_reason: "Now that the world's situation has changed, we cannot remain unchanged. We must open the path to self-strengthening by reforming the system."
je_korean_reformation_military: "National Wealth and Military Strength: Military System Reform"
je_korean_reformation_military_reason: "Looking back at the numerous evils of military administration, the Five Armies system, which has continued for many years, has only led to the evasion of military service and the desertion of soldiers. We must raise an army, train soldiers, and establish a systematic regular army system."
je_korean_reformation_economy: "National Wealth and Military Strength: Promoting Commerce and Industry"
je_korean_reformation_economy_reason: "As Yu Su-won said in the past, 'If a country wants to develop, all people must work hard in their respective roles, and there should be no distinction between noble and common.' The division of scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants is a long-standing teaching of Neo-Confucianism, but now, if scholars are prioritized and organized properly, the remaining farmers, artisans, and merchants will naturally work hard in their respective roles without coercion. This is the true distinction of the four classes and the path to national strength."
je_korean_reformation_diplomacy: "National Wealth and Military Strength: Diplomatic Reform"
je_korean_reformation_diplomacy_reason: "For the past hundreds of years, we have followed the principles of serving the great and befriending neighbors, but now we must adapt to change. By dispatching envoys and concluding treaties, we must engage with all nations on an equal footing to preserve our national sovereignty and promote our national interests."

eafp_korean_reformation_events.102.f: "\"Since the Three Dynasties, there has never been a time when educating talent was not considered a top priority, which is why schools, academies, and institutions were established. In general, schools must be established to cultivate talent, and talent must be cultivated to promote governance and edification. If the law of teaching people in the country is greatly established and even the common people in the alleys do not fail to learn, then the culture will flourish like the Three Dynasties. However, in recent times, it has become stagnant and lax, so the ways of governance are not clear and the country is not prospering.\"\n\n\"Looking back, the urgent task today is only to raise schools and cultivate talent, which will become a tool for cultivating fields and increasing wealth. If we drive the scholars who have studied Confucianism and make them carry books and enter schools, then in less than a year, the effect will surely be twice as great as that of other countries.\"\n\n\"The Ministry of Education should widely establish schools, and each government and county should also pay special attention to the establishment of schools and devise ways to teach with all their heart. After waiting for academic achievement, the court will select and employ the necessary talents. The parents of families who do not teach their children will be punished, and those children who do not follow the teachings and only play without doing anything will also be punished in all cases.\""

Henceforth, any newly appointed Panim officials must first come to the office to take the exam before being appointed. Also, even if Panim civil officials have previous positions or are transferred from other counties, they should be considered as new appointees upon their initial appointment.'"

eafp_korean_reformation_events.104.f: "'Korean script is our country's writing system. Those who know Korean script so little and despise it, even if they are good at other countries' languages and know a lot of foreign knowledge, it is difficult to call them Koreans. People who only know other countries' languages and do not know their own country's writing system have a mind to rely on others in whatever they do and follow the examples of others, which is more harmful than any other person in Joseon.\n\nIn many countries, countries without their own writing system have mostly become colonies of other countries. Joseon has a writing system but only reveres others' and despises its own, and values Chinese characters more than Korean script, which is a mind that is itself a colony of others.\n\nIf Korean script is widely used, learning will easily spread widely, so we must correct the habit of despising our writing system as vulgar vernacular.'"

eafp_korean_reformation_events.501.d: "Recently, discussions on the introduction of Western-style company systems have been actively taking place, and articles introducing Western company systems have been published one after another."
eafp_korean_reformation_events.501.f: "These days, all Western empires are establishing companies and gathering merchants, which is truly the foundation of prosperity. Commerce is not about making something that is not in one place disappear forever, nor is it about monopolizing something that is in one place and making it one's own, but about supplying goods that are here to places where they are not. It is also about adding goods that are left over there to those that are lacking here, which is how heaven nurtures people and people enjoy life. If this is abandoned, agriculture and industry will both be devastated, heaven will not be able to nurture people, and people will not be able to preserve their lives. That is why the ancient sages taught people to go to the market during the day to trade, seeing the image of the Seoheup (噬嗑) of the Book of Changes.\n\nHowever, for the past 4,000 years, merchants in the East have only known how to trade and exchange alone, and have not known how to gather together and manage together, so commerce has not prospered, and the country's situation has not improved for a long time. The West is not like that, and if one person cannot trade alone, they must do it with 10 people, and if 10 people cannot do it, they must do it with 100 or 1,000 people. Therefore, nothing, big or small, is not accomplished, one family becomes prosperous, and the country becomes rich, and they not only enjoy peace in one place, but also want to stand out in the whole world. From this point of view, the company's business is also an urgent matter that requires immediate attention, so we inform our colleagues of the Western people's Seongbeop (成法)."

eafp_korean_reformation_events.505.f: "In civilized countries, the streets are cleaned and watered daily to prevent dust from scattering, and places like sewage outlets are quickly covered to prevent them from being seen and to prevent the emission of odors. In particular, the sewage flowing in the ditches is prevented from seeping deep into the ground, and the ditches are constructed firmly with stone, brick, and lime to prevent seepage into the ground. This is called a sewer, and it is an important project for the city, along with the water supply for drinking water mentioned above.\n\nThe cities of our country should also plan to construct complete sewers, but this also requires a lot of expenses, just like the water supply, so it is difficult to renovate them right now. As a matter of urgency, it is important to cover the sewage outlets throughout the city and clean the ditches from time to time to ensure the smooth flow of sewage.
