eastasian_expansionism_events.1.d: "We have finally been recognized as a member of the 'civilized world', but that does not guarantee our safety. The Western Great Powers have already begun to occupy territories around us, and their greedy eyes will never stop. In this world of the survival of the fittest, we must choose: will we become a colony, or an empire?"
eastasian_expansionism_events.1.f: "\"The military superiority of the Western powers is clear. They are dividing the Asian continent as if it were a piece of cake. Their logic is simple - it is the law of nature that the strong devour the weak.\""

eastasian_expansionism_events.101.d: "An influential politician gave a speech emphasizing the need for overseas expansion. He argued that for the survival of the nation, it is not enough to simply protect the borders, but to extend our influence to areas where our interests are at stake."
eastasian_expansionism_events.101.f: "\"I believe there are two ways to defend national independence and self-determination: first, to protect the 'sovereign line,' and second, to protect the 'line of interest.' The sovereign line refers to the country's territory, and the line of interest refers to the area closely related to the security of the sovereign line.\n\nGenerally, every country has a sovereign line and a line of interest, but in order to maintain a country's independence among the current powers, it is not enough to protect only the sovereign line. I believe that the line of interest must also be protected.\""

eastasian_expansionism_events.102.f: "\"This is not just an assassination, but a patriotic act!\" the young man shouted in court.\n\n\"The defendant took the life of the Foreign Minister. How can this be called patriotism?\" the judge asked.\n\n\"He did not understand the sacred mission!

eastasian_expansionism_events.104.f: "\"Speaking of territorial expansion may sound dangerous, but the territorial expansion we are talking about never means occupying the territory of another country and planting a flag there to merge it into [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFormatting]. It is only because Western powers are suppressing the distribution of our goods and commodities overseas that we are looking for places overseas where [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFormatting]'s capital, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFormatting]'s technology, and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFormatting]'s labor can be free from the oppression of the white race and operate freely.\"" # Kingoro Hashimoto
