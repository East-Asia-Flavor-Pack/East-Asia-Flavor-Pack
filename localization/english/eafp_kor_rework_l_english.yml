Perhaps our generation is ready to undertake this task.\n\nCurrently, construction progress cannot be obtained."

Perhaps our generation is ready to undertake this task.\n\nCurrently, construction progress cannot be obtained."
je_rlg_seoul_gyeongbokgung_rebuild: "Rebuilding Gyeongbokgung"
je_rlg_seoul_gyeongbokgung_rebuild_reason: "To establish the authority of the state, we have decided to magnificently rebuild the Northern Palace. However, as this will consume numerous materials and budget, we must proceed carefully while monitoring the country's financial situation."
je_rlg_seoul_gyeongbokgung_rebuild_goal: "When the progress bar is filled, construction ends and the palace reconstruction is successfully completed. The construction progress added each month varies according to the amount of resources invested through [Concept('concept_production_method','$concept_production_methods$')] in the $building_gyeongbokgung_poor$ [concept_building]."
je_rlg_seoul_dangbaek: "Inflation"
je_rlg_seoul_dangbaek_reason: "As a result of various domestic circumstances, we have inevitably decided to issue large amounts of debased currency. However, this policy could bring shocks to the national economy, and we must manage inflationary pressures through various means."
je_rlg_seoul_dangbaek_goal: "Progress basically increases weekly according to the amount issued, and the level of increase varies depending on factors such as the precious metal content of the currency, minting technology, and the economic tier of the country."
eafp_kor_mainline.1500.t: "Rebuild Gyeongbokgung Palace?"
eafp_kor_mainline.1500.d: "Discussion on Rebuilding the Main Palace"
eafp_kor_mainline.1500.f: "Gyeongbokgung, as the main palace of Joseon, had maintained its status for a long time, but after being devastated during the Japanese and Manchu invasions, various circumstances prevented its restoration.\nToday, as internal turmoil and foreign barbarian threats shake the nation's discipline, opinions suggesting the reconstruction of the Northern Palace to strengthen our foundation have begun to emerge."
eafp_kor_mainline.1500.a: "This matter requires discussion."
eafp_kor_mainline.1501.t: "Donation Money"
eafp_kor_mainline.1501.d: "Securing Construction Funds"
eafp_kor_mainline.1501.f: "Palace construction certainly requires a substantial budget.\nSince our treasury alone cannot cover all the costs, a suggestion was made to collect donations called Wonnapjeon to supplement the construction expenses. Many noble families with good intentions have willingly contributed money."
eafp_kor_mainline.1501.a: "The nobility has become a great help!"
eafp_kor_mainline.1502.t: "Honoring Donors"
eafp_kor_mainline.1502.d: "Praise and Rewards"
eafp_kor_mainline.1502.f: "Although Wonnapjeon is basically a donation, it's rare for people to give large sums of money without any compensation.\nIf the court directly honors the donors with commendations and provides a small 'token of appreciation,' we might be able to maintain the donation atmosphere for a longer period."
eafp_kor_mainline.1502.a: "A donation is just a donation, but we can at least express our gratitude."
eafp_kor_mainline.1502.b: "Appoint suitable government positions to major donors."
eafp_kor_mainline.1503.t: "Voluntary Donations?"
eafp_kor_mainline.1503.d: "Rising Fatigue"
eafp_kor_mainline.1503.f: "As the court's encouragement for donations has gradually shifted from suggestions to requests, and now slowly to pressure, fatigue regarding donations is rising throughout society.\nAlthough we are still formally accepting them as donations, it seems we have already collected as much as possible within the country."
eafp_kor_mainline.1503.a: "But the name is the name, so at this point..."
eafp_kor_mainline.1503.b: "We welcome your voluntary donations!"
eafp_kor_mainline.1504.t: "Fire!"
eafp_kor_mainline.1504.d: "A great fire has broken out!"
eafp_kor_mainline.1504.f: "Shocking news.\nIn the midst of construction, a large fire broke out at the construction site last night, burning down numerous pavilions that had been built and spreading to the timber stacked as materials!\nThe flames were barely contained today, but there has been a massive loss of resources, which will cause significant delays in construction...\n\n#N Construction Progress -250#!"
eafp_kor_mainline.1504.a: "A sign of national ruin!"
eafp_kor_mainline.1504.b: "The end is near."
eafp_kor_mainline.1504.c: "If only the Geumhwadogam had remained..."
eafp_kor_mainline.1504.dy: "This is all because of those barbarians!!!"
eafp_kor_mainline.1504.e: "Oh..."
eafp_kor_mainline.1505.t: "Currency Debate"
eafp_kor_mainline.1505.d: "Opinions are raised that new currency should be issued"
eafp_kor_mainline.1505.f: "'We should mint new currency and circulate it widely.'\n'What nonsense is this? All precious metals are imported from Qing and Japan, how could you say such absurd things..'\n'Can you still not read the flow of the times? Day after day, Western cotton cloth enters indiscriminately, collapsing the livelihood of the people. Only by minting new high-value coins can we correct this.'\n'It's impossible to recklessly create large denominations, and even if we did, it would act as poison to Joseon!'\n'We have many pressing issues. The palace construction is also urgent! If you can speak so loudly, why don't you donate your entire fortune to the North Palace construction before speaking!'"
eafp_kor_mainline.1505.a: "Gentlemen, please calm yourselves..."
eafp_kor_mainline.1506.t: "Issuance of Dangbaekjeon"
eafp_kor_mainline.1506.d: "Left State Councillor Kim Byeonghak has reported."
eafp_kor_mainline.1506.f: "The people's lives are difficult and finances are depleted, yet we are undertaking major construction projects, making it impossible to sustain operations between departments.\nHumbly considering, money is something to be used with proper balance and restraint.\nIn the past, splitting Dangshipjeon or Dangohjeon into Dangijeon or Dangsamjeon was always a temporary expedient measure.\nNow that the nation's finances are severely depleted, there should be a principle of balancing profit and loss.\nIn my opinion, if we mint Dangbaekdaejeon and use it alongside the widely circulated Tongbo, it might help increase our finances to some extent.\n\n<A button to decide on issuing Dangbaekjeon will be activated in the journal.>"
eafp_kor_mainline.1506.a: "Your report is very good. Implement it immediately!"
eafp_kor_mainline.1507.t: "Petition"
eafp_kor_mainline.1507.d: "A petition regarding the Gyeongbokgung construction has been submitted."
eafp_kor_mainline.1507.f: "I humbly report.......(omitted)\nThe long construction has emptied the national treasury......(omitted)\nThe suffering of the people is immeasurable...(omitted)\nIt would be advisable to take a break from construction for a while."
eafp_kor_mainline.1507.a: "Your words are right. Proceed with the work at a measured pace.\n<Progress -50>"
eafp_kor_mainline.1507.b: "A valid point, but postponing it will result in greater losses.\n<Progress +-0>"
eafp_kor_mainline.1507.c: "#V SILENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#!\n<Progress +50>"
eafp_kor_mainline.1509.t: "The Miracle of Dangbaekjeon!"
eafp_kor_mainline.1509.d: "There's no such thing lololololol"
eafp_kor_mainline.1509.f: "No matter what lololol absolutely not!!!!!!!!!"
eafp_kor_mainline.1509.a: "The currency value will never return lolololololololololololol"
eafp_kor_mainline.1510.t: "Construction Complete"
eafp_kor_mainline.1510.d: "The Northern Palace has been rebuilt"
eafp_kor_mainline.1510.f: "Today, the Gyeongbokgung reconstruction project has officially been declared complete.\nAfter several eventful years, the main palace of Joseon has finally regained its original status!"

je_yangjeon_reason: "While [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s taxation system has undergone various reforms and originally had diverse tax categories, for several reasons we have long collected taxes at uniformly minimized rates. However, unlike in the times of ancient sages, this system has become unsustainable today, with taxes not being collected where they should be, while those who can barely afford to pay taxes bear the entire burden. Therefore, we have decided to restore our chaotic tax system through a land survey project, known as Yangjeon. Due to its nature, this project is massive in scale and will take a long time.\n\nHowever, existing privilege holders will not willingly relinquish their interests, and during the transitional period of tax normalization, there is a risk that our people will inevitably suffer from unintended additional tax burdens..."

Yu Maeng-yang presented 'Mencius,' reading from "King Xuan of Qi met Mencius at Snow Palace" to "One excursion, one pleasure becomes the standard for feudal lords." The King finished reading the newly learned portion and ordered the explanation of its meaning.\n\nYu Maeng-yang said, "This chapter is roughly the same as the dialogue at the Pond in the previous section. In the saying 'enjoy the people's joy, worry about the people's worries,' the two characters 'worry' and 'joy' are opposite in meaning but related in principle. If one worries about the people's worries, one will not know how to enjoy one's own joy, and if one enjoys one's own joy, one will also not know how to worry about the people's worries. The King of Qi only asked about 'joy,' but Mencius also mentioned 'worry,' generally meaning that if one does not understand the meaning of sharing worry, one also does not understand the meaning of sharing joy.\n\n'One excursion, one pleasure becomes the standard for feudal lords' means that the excursions and pleasures of the ancient kings were all related to the people's circumstances. Recently, when Your Majesty returned from visiting the royal tombs, the people of Paju and Goyang all received your caring grace, deeply embodying the meaning of the former kings' assistance. We respectfully look up to Your Majesty's governance that bestows benefits to the people. If this heart could be extended to reach the people of all eight provinces, it would be even better.

That is why Mencius urged him to be strong in doing good. This is not just true for this time; in all matters under Heaven, one cannot calculate success or failure, advantage or disadvantage, but can only fulfill one's principles. Therefore it is said, 'Make righteousness correct without scheming for profit, clarify the Way without calculating its achievements.' The fundamental principles of governance do not go beyond this.

The key to maintaining reverence also does not go beyond the single character 'sincerity.' Therefore it is said, 'Ultimate sincerity is without rest,' and also, 'Without sincerity, nothing can be accomplished.' Generally, in the study of sagehood, one must use sincerity and reverence as the work that penetrates up and down and completes from beginning to end, but if there is even a momentary interruption in daily activities, the expression of joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure will inevitably suffer from the illness of excess or deficiency, losing the essence of the great middle.

Sim Yu-jin presented the first volume of the 'Analects,' reading from "The Master said, 'To govern with virtue'" to "not going beyond the rules." The King finished reading the newly learned portion.\n\nSim Yu-jin said, "The reason 'Governing' chapter follows the 'Learning' chapter is to indicate that one can govern only after learning. 'Governing with virtue' is like 'the North Star stays in its place while all other stars position themselves around it,' which refers to the ruler's governance, generally comparing the 'pole' of the Imperial Ultimate to the 'pole' of the North Star. The North Star is the center of the sky; the sky is round and encompasses the outside, while the earth is square and sits in the center; the sky and the sun and moon revolve left and right, but the North and South Poles remain in one place without moving. Penetrating up and down, with the square earth in the center, this is what is called the great middle, and when one considers its form, it completely forms the shape of the character 'middle' and becomes the standard for all stars, which is why the North Star is more honorable than all other stars.\n\nThe ruler's establishment of middle governance is like this; by being precise and consistent in maintaining the middle way, without bias and focusing on one thing, the four directions will follow the example. Speaking of our country, if Your Majesty establishes the middle way in Hanyang, then subjects and people will follow it, the provincial governors will establish the middle within their provinces, the magistrates will establish the middle within their counties, and the people will each establish the middle within their families. This is what the Great Plan calls 'gathering to the Ultimate and returning to the Ultimate,' and what the Doctrine of the Mean calls 'achieving the middle harmony so that Heaven and Earth are in their places and all things flourish.'\n\n'Governing with virtue' comes from 'maintaining the middle way'; generally, the meaning of the character 'virtue' is 'upright mind,' and the meaning of the character 'governance' is 'teaching with uprightness,' where 'uprightness' means 'stopping at one,' all of which signify standing in the middle without moving. I humbly hope that Your Majesty will emulate the North Star staying in its place, maintain the middle way, accomplish virtue through this middle way, and govern with this virtue, so that not a single decree fails to originate from the character 'middle.' Then this governance will accord with Confucius's meaning of 'governing with virtue,' and Emperor Yao's radiance extending to the four corners and reaching up and down is nothing more than this. I hope Your Majesty will deeply keep such matters in mind.""

eafp_kor_mainline.89.mf: "The King said, "How do 'not worrying that others do not know oneself' and 'others not knowing yet not being resentful' from the first chapter of the Analects compare in terms of the depth of scholarly attainment?"\n\nNam Hak-mun replied, "There seems to be no difference in depth between 'not worrying' and 'not being resentful.'"\n\nThe King said, "That is not so. 'Others not knowing yet not being resentful' means that one's undivided mind is solely focused on cultivating oneself, only seeking what is within oneself, and whether others know one or not does not enter one's mind-this is precisely the learning of the gentleman for himself. 'Not worrying that others do not know oneself' seems to be a matter of encouraging and cautioning beginners. Generally, those who do not worry that others do not know them can also become gentlemen who are not resentful, but the meaning of the character 'resentful' lies in oneself, while the meaning of the character 'worry' lies in others-from this one can see the difference in depth between those who have accomplished virtue and beginners. Examining closely the meaning of the passage, the first chapter already speaks of 'not being resentful,' and this chapter speaks of 'not worrying,' which seems to be a teaching that penetrates from top to bottom."\n\nKim Jong-su replied, "It seems so."\n\nThe King said, "Now, due to this textual meaning, I suddenly have a thought. Mencius's saying 'seek the lost mind' refers to the initial work of scholars, but can it also be said of sages? Regarding the meaning of 'seeking the lost mind,' both Yi Hwang (Toegye) and Yi I (Yulgok) have discussed it, but their arguments differ. Generally, sages initially have no lost mind, so the character 'seek' cannot be applied, yet the principle of seeking the lost mind is not entirely absent."\n\nKim Jong-su replied, "Speaking of Yan Hui, it is said that 'for three months he did not violate benevolence,' which implies that after three months, there were times when he violated benevolence, and those times when he violated benevolence are precisely where this mind was set aside. Therefore, even in the position of sages and worthies, the principle of 'seeking' is not entirely absent."\n\nThe King said, "Between 'being poor yet without flattery' and Mencius's saying 'when seeing great men, regard them lightly,' which is superior and which is inferior in terms of attainment?"\n\nKim Jong-su replied, "'Being poor yet without flattery' involves an intention of calmly maintaining oneself, while 'regarding great men lightly' is too revealing of one's bearing. If we discuss which is superior, 'being poor yet without flattery' is even more difficult."\n\nThe King said, "That is not so. To 'regard great men lightly,' judging by the bearing, means not being bent by power and might, not being moved by poverty and lowliness, having the intention of 'even with ten thousand people opposed, I will proceed'-only then can one meet this standard. As for 'without flattery,' while it is not without difficulty, even those below the level of a gentleman who can somewhat maintain themselves can also achieve it, so there is a great difference in the depth of attainment."\n\nKim Jong-su said, "'Regarding great men lightly' reveals too much angularity, and seems not as good as 'being poor yet without flattery' and calmly maintaining oneself.""
