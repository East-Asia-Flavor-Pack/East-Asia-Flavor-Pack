je_donghak_movement: "Donghak Peasant Movement"
je_donghak_movement_reason: "Eastern Learning, or Donghak, has begun to spread among the [GetPopType('peasants').GetName] of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] as the country opens up and comes into contact with the outside world. Donghak followers, who are mostly affiliated with the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('donghak_ig').GetName], tend to advocate for equality and rights for all people and reject foreign intervention.\n\nThe infrastructure created by Donghak followers is spread throughout the country and could be used as a means to quickly organize insurgent groups in the future."

je_gyojo_shinwon_reason: "Donghak followers of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('donghak_ig').GetName] have submitted a petition to the court demanding tolerance for Donghak teachings, expulsion of foreigners, and execution of corrupt [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('yangban_ig').GetName] officials.\n\nSocial unrest has temporarily subsided as the court has promised to listen to their demands. However, if the government ignores the petition, revolutionary activities will erupt once again."
je_korean_rebellion: "Korean Revolution"
je_korean_rebellion_reason: "Rebellions across [SCOPE.sCountry('korea_scope').GetName] are threatening the balance of power in the country. The overthrow of [SCOPE.sCharacter('korea_ruler_scope').GetFullName], the [SCOPE.sCharacter('korea_ruler_scope').GetPrimaryRoleTitle], will surely lead to [SCOPE.sCountry('korea_scope').GetNameNoFormatting]'s independence. It may also provide an opportunity for European powers to secure influence on the Korean peninsula."

gg_korea.1.t: "Donghak"
gg_korea.1.d: "Inspired by the teachings of Donghak, [GetPopType('peasants').GetName] have begun to organize throughout [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Demands for social equality, religious tolerance, and the exclusion of foreign influence are growing too loud to ignore."
gg_korea.1.f: "In the year of Sinyu, scholars came from all directions to ask, \"We heard that Hanulnim descended upon you. What exactly happened?\"\n\nI answered, \"I have received the principle of eternal return, that which never fails to come and go.\"\n\n\"What should we call this way?\"\n\n\"The Way of Heaven, 'Cheondo.'\"\n\n\"How is it different from Western teachings?\"\n\n\"It seems similar to Western Learning, but there are differences. Western Learning has form but lacks substance. The rhyme is one, and the way is also one, but it can be said that the principles are different.\"" #- Donggyeong Daejeon

gg_korea.2.t: "Donghak Peasant Revolution"
gg_korea.2.d: "The discontent among the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('donghak_ig').GetName] people has grown and erupted into open conflict. Across [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], peasants have organized revolutionary groups based on Donghak teachings."
gg_korea.2.f: "Instructions were given to all villagers. They were to rush to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] as quickly as possible to drive out foreigners and exterminate the [SCOPE.sCharacter('gov_leader_scope').GetLastNameNoFormatting] clan.\n\nIt was a merciful march that saved innocent people and their property, provided supplies, and inspired loyalty and piety in the hearts of all witnesses. This was completely different from the actions of the notorious government soldiers."
gg_korea.2.a: "Mobilize the army and prepare for battle."
gg_korea.3.t: "Eastern Learning"
gg_korea.3.d: "In the [SCOPE.sState('choi_je_wooor_state').GetName] region, [SCOPE.sCharacter('choi_je_woo_scope').GetFullName] has advocated a new ideology called Donghak. Donghak appeals to equality for all and aims to build heaven on earth."
gg_korea.3.f: "\"The West wins when it fights and takes when it strikes, achieving everything it attempts, so when the world is destroyed, there will be no escape from disaster. Where will the strategy to protect the country and bring peace to the people come from? Alas! People of today do not understand the times. They hear my words, doubt them in their hearts, gather to whisper among themselves, and do not follow moral principles. This is truly frightening.\"" #- Donggyeong Daejeon
gg_korea.3.a: "It is a comfort that soothes the worries of the people."
gg_korea.3.b: "It's nothing more than dangerous nonsense that deceives the world."
gg_korea.4.ta: "Samrye Assembly"
gg_korea.4.tb: "[SCOPE.sState('petition_state').GetFarmHubName] Assembly"
gg_korea.4.d: "Donghak followers have submitted a petition to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName]'s [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] court demanding a series of reforms. Their demands include religious tolerance, expulsion of foreigners, and execution of corrupt officials."
gg_korea.4.f: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] was already aware of the Donghak followers. Reports of organizations forming in the countryside, and countless letters and petitions sent to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim] and officials had made sure of that. The content of every line was consistent. After reading the introduction expressing loyalty to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim], the explanation of demands would follow.\n\nThis was certainly not the first time such a situation had occurred. However, this group was clearly of the most interest. The newly formed peasant collective could either be alienated or provoke the court's anger. There are only these two options available."
gg_korea.4.a: "Threaten them with consequences if they do not disperse."
gg_korea.4.b: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] will listen to this petition."
gg_korea.5.t: "In-Nae-Cheon"
gg_korea.5.d: "Through careful reforms and cooperation with [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('donghak_ig').GetName], the Donghak Peasant Movement has been pacified. Now [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] must continue in harmony while completely isolated from the world."
gg_korea.5.f: "The last ship has left the port. Finally, the banner of isolation has been raised. Somewhere across the sea, shocked European merchants are writing reports to submit to their governments. The Westerners will return somehow, heavily armed.\n\nBut the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetPortHubName] have also learned something new. There seems to be an invisible energy circulating in their daily lives. Yes, the people no longer fear ships and guns. And they no longer see each other as the greatest threat. When the Westerners return, their favorite tactic of divide and rule will not work. There won't even be a hint of division among these people. Is it really possible to occupy such a reserve army of millions with just an expeditionary force?"
gg_korea.5.a: "We have realized justice and comradeship."
gg_korea.5.b: "We will build paradise in the mountains."
gg_korea.6.t: "Neglect"
gg_korea.6.d: "Too much time has passed waiting for the promised reforms. The Donghak Peasant Movement's patience has run out. The people of [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('donghak_ig').GetName] are overwhelmed with feelings of betrayal and are on the verge of uprising."
gg_korea.6.f: "Another messenger lost. Despite the family's hopes, the investigator calmly concluded that this messenger, too, would never be seen again. Tax collectors, census takers, messengers, police... in this region, anyone who strayed from the path began to disappear. While some did return safely, even the disappearance of a few was enough to indicate that something was changing. Fear began to circulate in the previously indifferent barracks. And this atmosphere did not seem likely to change easily.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFormatting] no longer appeared as a unified nation but rather as a cluster of cities barely connected by thin spider webs. Just stepping slightly beyond the boundaries meant facing all kinds of contempt from the vast and terrible outside."
gg_korea.6.a: "We must accept the consequences."

The rule of [SCOPE.sCountry('korea_scope').GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCountry('korea_scope').GetRuler.GetFullName] is under threat. This rebellion presents a good opportunity to expand our influence in [SCOPE.sCountry('korea_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] much further at the expense of [SCOPE.sCountry('china_scope').GetName]."
gg_korea.7.d.china: "Rebellions have broken out like wildfire across [SCOPE.sCountry('korea_scope').GetName]. The rule of the loyal [SCOPE.sCountry('korea_scope').GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] is under threat. If the rebellion succeeds and the government is overthrown, [SCOPE.sCountry('korea_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] will be defenseless against foreign powers."
gg_korea.7.f: "The entire room became busy when the telegram arrived. Reports from [SCOPE.sCountry('korea_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] were delivering a string of bad news. Normally, those reading this might have felt like the air was being sucked from their lungs. But now it's different. They weren't the only ones reading such reports. It was obvious that competitors across the East Sea would be in exactly the same situation. Whether by land or sea, it had now become a race to see who could mobilize troops faster."
gg_korea.7.a: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('korea_scope').GetAdjective] government must be maintained."
gg_korea.7.b: "If the rebellion succeeds, our interests will grow."
gg_korea.7.c: "There's no reason to pay attention to this."
gg_korea.8.t: "Opportunity in [SCOPE.sCountry('korea_scope').GetName]"
gg_korea.8.d: "We have repelled the rebellion in [SCOPE.sCountry('korea_scope').GetNameNoFormatting]. This victory has given us an opportunity to favorably shape the post-war order. If we demand that [SCOPE.sCountry('china_scope').GetName] officially recognize the independence of [SCOPE.sCountry('korea_scope').GetNameNoFormatting], we can establish our influence in the region much more effectively."
gg_korea.8.f: "\"There is nothing more to expect from the Yangban forces, but some ministers have a relatively modern sense of political affairs.\"\n\n\"Who are you referring to?\"\n\n\"[SCOPE.sCharacter('industrialists_leader_scope').GetLastNameNoFormatting], [SCOPE.sCharacter('intelligentsia_leader_scope').GetLastNameNoFormatting], perhaps [SCOPE.sCharacter('pb_leader_scope').GetLastNameNoFormatting] would be good too.

gg_korea.9.t: "[SCOPE.sCountry('japan_scope').GetName]'s Demand for Withdrawal from [SCOPE.sCountry('korea_scope').GetName]"
gg_korea.9.d: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('japan_scope').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] government has sent us various demands. Among them, the clause demanding withdrawal from [SCOPE.sCountry('korea_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] could be considered the most important content. This was because the remaining forces on the Korean peninsula, who refused to withdraw despite the defeat of the rebels, were positioned as the backing for their demands."
gg_korea.9.f: "The printer looked at the decree with fear. With each line being printed, the cloud of smoke also grew in size as if indicating ominousness. The situation was heading toward a dark climax. Chaos was swirling due to the rebellion. [SCOPE.sCountry('japan_scope').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] was condemned in the most severe terms. Their reckless actions were listed as dryly as rifles aiming at the execution platform.\n\n\"Difficult to rationalize\", \"Lacking in provocative power\", \"Insufficient satisfactory explanation\". These were euphemisms that the troubled government had agonized over. Had the situation not suddenly changed, it would have been more than enough to cause a war."
gg_korea.9.a: "Joseon is like a troublesome burden."
